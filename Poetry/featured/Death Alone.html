<hp5>
There are lone cemeteries,					<br>
tombs full of soundless bones,					<br>
the heart threading a tunnel,					<br>
a dark, dark tunnel :						<br>
like a wreck we die to the very core,				<br>
as if drowning at the heart					<br>
or collapsing inwards from skin to soul.			<br><br>

There are corpses,						<br>
clammy slabs for feet,						<br>
there is death in the bones,					<br>
like a pure sound,						<br>
a bark without its dog,						<br>
out of certain bells, certain tombs				<br>
swelling in this humidity like lament or rain.			<br><br>

I see, when alone at times,					<br>
coffins under sail						<br>
setting out with the pale dead, women in their dead braids,	<br>
bakers as white as angels,					<br>
thoughtful girls married to notaries,				<br>
coffins ascending the vertical river of the dead,		<br>
the wine-dark river to its source,				<br>
with their sails swollen with the sound of death,		<br>
filled with the silent noise of death.				<br><br>

Death is drawn to sound						<br>
like a slipper without a foot, a suit without its wearer,	<br>
comes to knock with a ring, stoneless and fingerless,		<br>
comes to shout without a mouth, a tongue, without a throat.	<br>
Nevertheless its footsteps sound				<br>
and its clothes echo, hushed like a tree.			<br><br>

I do not know, I am ignorant, I hardly see			<br>
but it seems to me that its song has the colour of wet violets,	<br>
violets well used to the earth,					<br>
since the face of death is green,				<br>
and the gaze of death green					<br>
with the etched moisture of a violet's leaf			<br>
and its grave colour of exasperated winter.			<br><br>

But death goes about the earth also, riding a broom		<br>
lapping the ground in search of the dead -			<br>
death is in the broom,						<br>
it is the tongue of death looking for the dead,			<br>
the needle of death looking for the thread.			<br><br>

Death lies in our beds :					<br>
in the lazy mattresses, the black blankets,			<br>
lives a full stretch and then suddenly blows,			<br>
blows sound unknown filling out the sheets			<br>
and there are beds sailing into a harbour			<br>
where death is waiting, dressed as an admiral.			<br><br>
